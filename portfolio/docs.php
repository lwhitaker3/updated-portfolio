              <h3>The Ask</h3>
              <p>Conduct a Heuristic review and run usability tests on the DOCS website to explore areas for improvement as well as finding elements that work on the existing site.</p>
              <h3>Project Description</h3>
              <p>The objectives of this usability test was to evaluate the website through the following attributes: efficiency, effectiveness, satisfaction. A total of 6 participants attempted to complete 5 tasks related to functions on the DOCs website. Through this process, 4 positive elements and 33 opportunities for improvement emerged from the website.</p>
              <p>Participants indicated that they liked the colorful nature and interactivity-- the present of videos and images--of the site. The placement of the share function was intuitive to participants and they appreciated the error message when the form was not filled out. Mixed results were found regarding task times and task completion rates-- some tasks were quickly completed while other tasks took longer or were not completed in the time frame allowed (M= 117s, R= 39s-218s). Specifically, participants were able to quickly share the website but struggled on tasks where they had to locate specific information (i.e. learning about patients impacted by the DOCs program) (Average Completion Rate across tasks = 0.37, R= 0.17-1).</p>
              <p>The average System Usability Score (SUS) is 26.6%-- a very low score below average. Overall, the site lacks information architecture and hierarchy. The main opportunities for improvement are related to the main navigation bar and the  lack of sub navigation which can lead to a loss of sense of place within the site. Participants also identified issues with the general content strategy and specific content on panels. Overall, the site contains too much text, the content strategy is not clear, and content can lack context. This was revealed by participants when they found it difficult to find specific content from panel descriptions. Within site panels, participants mentioned that text was too small, the site lacks descriptions of videos and images, and videos are too long.</p>

Then as a group, we sat together and created a master list of issues we found. From there we put together a detailed report of all of the problems we found before we conducted the research.</p>

We ran pilot studies to refine the task scenarios and make sure they were as clear as possible without being too obvious.</p>
