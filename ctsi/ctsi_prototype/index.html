              <p>You told us that you believe that you have private insurance coverage or that you are covered by Medicare or Medicaid. This can make participating in a clinical trial or research study easier. Insurance, including Medicare and Medicaid, are generally required to cover all expenses associated with your medical treatment.  Although the cost of new medicines or forms of treatment might not be covered, you can ask your doctor or nurse whether the sponsor of the study (like the government or drug company) will pay these expenses.  These are often covered.  At the same time, many types of studies don’t require insurance at all, or may even provide you with a small amount of pay to thank you for your time.  These types of studies often involve interview or survey research and take as little as 30 minutes of your time.  What researchers can learn, though, can help many patients like you.</p>

But before you decide, talk to our clinical trial navigator at (***).  We may have a study you can participate in that doesn’t involve actually treating your disease.  For example, we need to understand how people cope with their disease.  We also need to learn more about how health conditions affect family members.  These types of studies just need your time to answer questions about your life and your behaviors.  These studies can help us learn a lot about how to help people like you.
